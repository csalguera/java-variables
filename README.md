## Java Variables

## Creator

```
public class Creator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "James Gosling"
    int yearCreated = 1995; 
  }
}
```

In ```Creator.java```, we have defined some variables related to James Gosling, the creator of Java.

Inside ```main()```, use ```System.out.println()``` to print out the variable name.

Use the same command to print out ```yearCreated```.

## CountComment

```
public class CountComment {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // This is where you will define your variable

    // This is where you will print your variable

  }

  // This is the end of the class
}

// This is outside the class
```

The file CountComment.java has a number of comments in it.

In your head, count the number of comments. Then, inside the main() method, declare a variable called numComments that holds how many comments you counted.
