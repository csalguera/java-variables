## Java Variables

## Creator

```
public class Creator {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    String name = "James Gosling"
    int yearCreated = 1995; 
  }
}
```

In ```Creator.java```, we have defined some variables related to James Gosling, the creator of Java.

Inside ```main()```, use ```System.out.println()``` to print out the variable name.

Use the same command to print out ```yearCreated```.

## CountComment

```
// This is the class declaration
public class CountComment {
  // This is the main method that runs when you compile
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // This is where you will define your variable

    // This is where you will print your variable

  }

  // This is the end of the class
}

// This is outside the class
```

The file ```CountComment.java``` has a number of comments in it.

In your head, count the number of comments. Then, inside the ```main() method```, declare a variable called ```numComments``` that holds how many comments you counted.

Print out ```numComments```.

## MarketShare

```
public class MarketShare {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
```

As of 2016, Android has ```81.7``` percent of the market share for mobile operating systems. Create a variable called ```androidShare``` that holds this percentage as a ```double```.

Print out androidShare to the console.

## Booleans

```
public class Booleans {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

  }
}
```

Create a variable called ```intsCanHoldDecimals```. Set it to ```true``` if the ```int type``` can hold a decimal number. Set it to ```false``` if the ```int type``` cannot do this.

Print out your ```intsCanHoldDecimals``` variable.

## Char

```
public class Char {
	public static void main(String[] args) {   

	}
}
```

Create a variable called expectedGrade of type char.

Fill it with a single letter, representing the grade you think you would get in a graded Java course where the grades A, B, C, D and F are possible.

Print out your expectedGrade variable!

## Song

```
public class Song {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
```

Create a variable called openingLyrics that has a value of: "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away"

Call System.out.println() to print out openingLyrics.
